After heavy drinking and getting caught in the rain, he suddenly developed symptoms including chills, high fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain, and subsequently coughing with rusty sputum. He was urgently brought to the local hospital by his family. On auscultation, there were abundant moist rales in the lower lobe of the left lung. Increased tactile fremitus was felt on palpation. Blood routine examination showed a white blood cell count of 17X10Â°. X-ray examination revealed a large dense shadow in the lower lobe of the left lung. After receiving antibiotic treatment in the hospital, his condition improved and various symptoms gradually disappeared. Follow-up X-ray examination showed that the dense shadow in the lower lobe of the left lung had reduced by 2/3 in size. The patient felt asymptomatic and was discharged on the 7th day of hospitalization. During the winter military recruitment physical examination, an irregular shadow measuring approximately 3cm X 2cm was found in the lower lobe of the left lung, with unclear boundaries, raising suspicion of bronchial lung cancer. He immediately underwent a left lower lobectomy at the local hospital. Pathological examination revealed a reddish-brown meat-like mass grossly and granulation tissue microscopically.",
